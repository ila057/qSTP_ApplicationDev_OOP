Hello friends,

Hope you are enjoying your vacations, and reading from the books as well. Please actively post your doubts on the group, or call us. 

We will be posting the notes on topics that are to be covered in the week, and you will have to complete labs based on that topic. From the matter that you have read so far, you should be able to try the attached practice question.

In the coming week, we will be finishing the basics of constructors, classes, objects & methods. So try to read up on these topics from the posted books or Internet.
