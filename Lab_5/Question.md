1.       In the class AddMeet, the action to be performed on clicking the submit button includes taking the contents of topic, date and time textboxes and writing them into a text file meeting.txt. Remember that any work involving input and output from files must be written inside try-catch.

You might want to use BufferedWriter and FileWriter class for it.

(import java.io.BufferedWriter and import java.io.FileWriter)

 

2.       Make a new class ViewMeet, and make a frame inside it. This frame contains a TextArea view, which displays all the contents on text file meeting.txt. For this, you will need to read the contents of meeting.txt and store in inside a string everything, and set the text of the TextArea view as everything.

You might want to use BufferedReader and FileReader class for it.

(import java.io.BufferedReader and import java.io.FileReader)

 

3.       Change the MeetingMgmt class, so that the frame in class ViewMeet is called when the button seesch is clicked.
