1.      Login and Password page

To create the Applet, create a new class Login_Pswd and extend it to inherit the inbuilt class JApplet. This class will implement ActionListener.

 

2.      Create two labels asking to enter loginID (login) and password (pswd). Also create a TextField to input the login (loginbox) and a PasswordField to input the password (pswdbox).

 

3.      Create a submit button. On clicking that button, your applet should take the loginID and password from the user, and compare the loginID to “abc” and password to “123”.

 

4.      If there is a match, the main menu (MainMenu) that you have already built should come up. If there is no match, it should display “Incorrect Login-ID and Password”
